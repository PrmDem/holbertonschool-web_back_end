# Python - NoSQL
Where SQL uses structured tables and relationships to organise data, NoSQL is the flexible alternative. It stores unstructured data, allows for greater scalability and an overall better performance for large amounts of data.<br/>
Through this project we'll learn how to use MongoDB, which stores data in JSON-like documents – eg key-value pairs in a dictionary.

## Requirements
### For Python files:
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.9)
* All files should start with `#!/usr/bin/env python3` and end with a new line
* Code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.)
* File length will be tested using wc
* All functions, modules, and classes should have a documentation
* All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated
### For MongoDB command files:
* All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using MongoDB (version 4.4)
* All files should start with a comment and end with a new line
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
