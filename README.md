# Web: back-end

In order to accomplish more in our web applications, we will learn here how to deal with asynchronous functions in both Python and JavaScript (ES6).<br/>We will also learn pagination to better deal with load times and offer a better experience to users, NoSQL databases for projects that need more flexibility, and Promises.


Every project in this repository includes its own README file, where the requirements for the project and the various tasks are listed.<br/>
